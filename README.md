App Tagline: App for students to make easy money by connecting them to organizations/people offering rewards for gigs, research participation, surveys, etc.

Our app is a gig based app which students in Cornell will use to make money through completing one time tasks. At Cornell many organizations offer money, credit, or other compensation for students participating in tasks such as postering, taking part in research, surveying, or providing entertainment. Our app provides a space for people to post listing, and for others to take these listings in exchange for compensation.

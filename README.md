APP DESCRIPTION: Our app is a gig based app which students in Cornell will use to make money through completing one time tasks. At Cornell many organizations offer money, credit, or other compensation for students participating in tasks such as postering, taking part in research, surveying, or providing entertainment. Our app provides a space for people to post listing, and for others to take these listings in exchange for compensation.

IOS ELEMENTS: For our app, we used SnapKit, a DSL to make Auto Layout easy on iOS. We implemented UICollectionViews for filters and job postings. In addition, we used UITabBar and UINavigationController to navigate between different screens.
